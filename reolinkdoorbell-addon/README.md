Easily integrate your Reolink doorbell with Home Assistant! This add-on listens for doorbell button press events and notifies you with a persistent notification containing a link to a dedicated "Doorbell" tab in your Home Assistant dashboard. It can also wake a tablet running the Home Assistant dashboard using Fully Kiosk Browser or the Companion App.

## Features
- Detects Reolink doorbell button press via Home Assistant WebSocket API
- Wakes up a wall tablet (Fully Kiosk or Companion App)
- Sends a persistent notification with a link to the "Doorbell" dashboard tab
- Configurable camera and lock entities
- Extensible for additional actions and devices

## Configuration
All configuration is done via the Home Assistant add-on UI. No files need to be edited manually.

- `camera_entity`: Camera entity for live video (e.g., `camera.reolink_doorbell`)
- `lock_entity`: Lock or switch entity to open the door (e.g., `lock.front_door`)
- `tablet_ip`: IP address of the wall tablet
- `fully_kiosk_password`: Password for Fully Kiosk REST API
- `device_control_method`: `fully_kiosk` or `companion_app`

### Required: Home Assistant Token
You must provide a Home Assistant long-lived access token as an environment variable named `HASS_TOKEN` when running the add-on. See [Home Assistant docs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token) for how to create one.

### Optional: Companion App Notify Service
If using the Companion App for device wake, set the `COMPANION_NOTIFY_SERVICE` environment variable to your notify service (e.g., `notify.mobile_app_tablet`).

## Setup
1. Install the add-on in Home Assistant Supervisor.
2. Open the add-on UI and configure the options above.
3. Add a new tab (view) to your Home Assistant dashboard called "Doorbell".
4. Place your camera stream and action buttons on this tab (see example below).
5. When the doorbell is pressed, you'll receive a persistent notification with a link to the "Doorbell" tab.
